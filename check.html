                    Durability<br>
                    Durability is the property which guarantees the ability to withstand a certain amount of force. 
                    This is not to be confused with endurance; while durability is the ability to withstand damage, 
                    endurance is a measure of stamina. Logically, characters capable of physically achieving a certain degree of energy output, must be able to at least withstand a comparable amount of damage, or their bodies would break apart from the strain and automatic counterforce, whenever they exert themselves.;<br>
                    <br>
                    your Durability is calculated by the highest striking strength damage in a single stike you have tanked without dying <br>

                <h5 id="acolyte">acolyte</h5><br>
                <p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
                    <br>
                    Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Technique Proficiencies: Insight, Religion</li>
                    <li>Languages: Two of your choice</li>
                    <li>Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful </strong>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
                    <br>
                    You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.<br>
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.<br>

                <p><strong>Trait -- Guild-Membership: </strong><br>You are a member of a guild that is connected to your chosen craft. Fellow members of the guild will provide you with lodging and food. In some cities and towns a guild hall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession.
                  Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
                  You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues in order to remain in the guild's good graces.

                <h5 id="Bounty_Hunter">Bounty Hunter</h5><br>
                <p>However fine and noble the world might have seemed at first glance, once you dug a little deeper beneath the facade, a deeper truth revealed itself to you. Conflict and strife are the only real constants in "civilized" lands, and for you, therein lay the opportunity for profit. As a bounty hunter you had plied your trade well, offering dubious (if effective) services and skills to all manner of client for myriad reasons- superficial or otherwise. Regardless of the cause, the justification, or the moral impunity associated with locating your mark. Every job finished brought the clink of coin between your purse strings at the expense of another poor soul fated to endure consequences dire, and often foul.

                  Though the time spent in this line of work has left you grim and jilted, your reputation for ruthlessness and cunning precedes you. More often than not, you found yourself sought after and petitioned to ferret a mark, never needing to eke out the work on your own. From the lowly debtor owing the wrong merchant guild, to the misguided runaway offspring of a minor noble, or the thieving murderer eluding the city guard, none could evade your dogged pursuit, and many more dared not try once your involvement was learned.</p><br>

                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Equipment: </strong><br>Ink bottle, a set of traveler's clothes, ink pen, 5 pages of parchment, 2 hunting traps, thieves' tools, 3 trinkets from previous bounties (roll on table PHB pg. 160-161), and a belt pouch containing 10 gold
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Names, Faces, and Places</strong><br>Though many claim the role of a bounty hunter, few actually excel at the profession save those with a keen eye for observation. Among the adept are those who are truly gifted, having an almost preternatural talent for anticipating the behavior of their targeted mark. Being among their ranks, you have an uncanny ability to recall specific details of conversation and names you overhear or participate in as it relates to your bounty, or otherwise see written, even if only for a moment or two. You can also sketch out faces and general locations you've seen with accuracy, possessing exceptional recollection. In addition, you often effortlessly identify clues when tracking your bounty's movements and disposition that would be otherwise lost on lesser pursuers.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Contacts and Forgery</strong><br>As a bounty hunter you have traveled far and wide which has allowed you to have built up a network of contacts and informants that can help you track down your mark. If you are in a town or city where one of your contacts or informants reside (DM's discretion) you may inquire about information that pertains to your mark for the right price or trade a favor to gain the information (DM's discretion). Additionally you have trained yourself in creating documents that will allow you to gain entry into areas you would normally not be allowed to enter in order to capture your mark. You can forge documents including officials papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or handwriting you are trying to copy.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Ear to the Ground</strong><br>You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen mark moves through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people, places and the political standings of the local area.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>A bounty hunter's sole purpose is to hunt down people with a price on their head, for grievances ranging from the mundane to the terrible. Those who follow this life can be quiet, taciturn individuals as readily as they can be savage brutes living not for the pay, but for the thrill of pursuit. Hunters are therefore often as varied in personality as their marks.

                  You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books.
                  It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
                  You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver.

                <h5 id="City_Watch">City Watch</h5><br>
                <p>You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. 
                Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. You might have been part of the City 
                Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant 
                defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, 
                the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands. Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law
                 enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.

                    <li>techniques Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight</li>
                    <li>Languages: Two of your choice</li>
                    <li>Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Watcher's Eye</strong><br> Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals.
                  You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter. 
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant: Investigator</strong><br>Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk a re seldom found in
                  rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics. 
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player 's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch. Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.

                  You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.</p><br>

But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics.
There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

                <h5 id="Entertainer">Entertainer</h5><br>
                <p>You thrive in front of an audience.
                  You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them.
                  Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger.
                  Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow.
                  Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick.
                  Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.</p><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>techniques Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance</li>
                    <li>Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, one type of musical instrument</li>
                    <li>Equipment: A musical instrument (one o f your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), a costume, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Entertainer Routines: 
                  A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines.
                  Choose one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: By Popular Demand</strong><br> You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court.
                  At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night.
                  In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure.
                  When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant: Gladiator</strong><br>A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy.
                  This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor.
                  Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club.
                  You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities.
                  They’re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.

                <p>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born. You aren't one of those folk. You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerun for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</p><br>

                  A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary.

                <p>Where Are You From?<br>
                  The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.<br><b>Select a country from the list of countries</b></p><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: All Eyes On You</strong><br> Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland. You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant: Investigator</strong><br>Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk a re seldom found in
                  rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics.

                <p>You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.
                  You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself.
                  You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you.
                  You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate.
                  You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
                  You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.
                  How did you come by that money?

                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: City Secrets</strong><br> You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss.
                  When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. 
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>Urchins are shaped by lives o f desperate poverty, for good and for ill.
                  They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

                <p><strong>Feature: Echo of the Great Game</strong><br> Years of stealth and trickery have taught you how to not draw attention to yourself. The way you walk, talk and move are deliberately forgettable, and utterly unextraordinary. While you are wearing common clothes, no one can remember your face nor any features about you, unless they actively make an effort to do so.
                  In addition, you know how to write in a special code that can only be read by people trained in deciphering it.

                <p>War has been your life for as long as you care to remember.
                  You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield.
                  You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
                  When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career.
                  Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia?
                  Or it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s private army, or a mercenary company.

                <p><strong>Feature: Military Rank</strong><br> You have a military rank from your career as a soldier.
                  Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank.
                  You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use.
                  You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

                <p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years.
                  In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths.
                  Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.
                  Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master.
                  Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship?
                  How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled?
                  Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?
                  What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position?
                  Who were the captain and first mate?
                  Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?</p><br>

                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Ship's Passage</strong><br> When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions.
                  You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate).
                  Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need.
                  Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go.
                  In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant: Pirate</strong><br>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages.
                  You’ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave.
                  Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.
                  If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship’s Passage feature.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant Feature: Bad Reputation</strong><br>If your character has a sailor background, you may select this background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.
                  No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation.
                  When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>
                  Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well.
                  Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

                <p><strong>Feature: Researcher--</strong><br> When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it.
                  Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature.
                  Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.
                  Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

                <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics: </strong><br>Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study.
                  Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.

                <h5 id="City_Watch">City Watch</h5><br>
                <p></p><br>You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. 
                Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. You might have been part of the City 
                Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant 
                defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, 
                the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands. Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law
                 enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.
                <ul>
                    <li>techniques Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight</li>
                    <li>Languages: Two of your choice</li>
                    <li>Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Feature: Watcher's Eye</strong><br> Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals.
                  You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter. 
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Variant: Investigator</strong><br>Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk a re seldom found in
                  rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics.
