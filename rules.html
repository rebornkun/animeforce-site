                <h3>Insight and Guidelines of the Game mechanics !!</h3><br>

                <h4>Balancing Rules</h4><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a turn is skipped you lose 2hp but gain 2cp generally, although some races might say otherwise</li>  
                    <li>Note if your hands are cut off you wont be able to use skills that requires hand, the admin will be the judge of such skills.</li>
                    <li>Normally you can only use 2 reactions per turn</li>
                    <li>while healing or filling cp, you cant gain more than your limit unless it specifies so.</li>
                    <li>the buff or damage reduction system goes like this, if you take like 20dmg and the damage is suppose
                        to be reduced by 5 by an opponent effect, and it is supposed to be buffed by 2 by your own effect. it is buff by 2
                        first and then it is reduced by 5. on another note, if you want to deal dmg, lets say 5, and it is supposed to be increased
                        by 2 then 2 again and then multiplied by 2, multiplication will first takes place before any other buff but debuff happens last.
                    </li>
                    <li>dying-- when you die you have to wait for 3hrs x your rank (F=1, E=2) for you to revive and continue gaming unless special cases like using using revival and others. 
                        while dead you cannot not play online battles or download online content like new story mode and other. you can pay 5gp each hour left to reduce your death sentence</li>
                    <li>residual damage-- when you escape or win a battle that is not a friendly battle like death match or raids,
                        you have to use potions or stuff that heal your health if not you will be entering the next battle with your residual health
                        . you heal per hour depending on your race.
                    </li>
                    <li>Time scale in this game is 10sec per turn</li>
                    <li>Recharge 5-6 means it can be used again after 5 or 6 turns. </li>
                    <li>Stealing-- in some places you can steal, depends on the rarity of the item thats how you know the DC, normal-5DC, rare-10DC e.t.c
                      you must roll a d20 die and get a number above the dc if not oyu are caught and dont get the item succesfully from place. 
                    sometimes you might be caught even if you roll right</li>
                    <li>you can attack npc, but you will be chased by royal guards. if you are captured where the duration will be 
                      based on the crime committed. the guards after you will be sent based on your lv so be carful. same thing will happen if you fight in cities/safe zone</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                  <h5 id="skills">Categories of Skills</h5><br>
                  <p>they are categories of skills;<br>
                      Charged and physical</p><br>
                  <p>Charged skills are skills that required some kind of energy to work<br>
                      they can also be split into;<br>
                      unarmed Charged: these are charged attacks that don't require weapons to use<br>
                      armed charged: these are charged attacks that require a sort of weapon to use 
                  </p><br>
                  <p>physical skills are skills that dont required some kind of energy to work just pure strength or agility<br>
                      they can also be split into;<br>
                      unarmed physical: these are uncharged attacks that dont require weapons to use just the raw body<br>
                      armed physical: these are uncharged attacks that require a sort of weapon to use 
                  </p><br>
                  <p>Skills can also be judged by distance<br>
                      melee: this type of skills can only be used in close range from 5 to 10ft from you, 
                      meaning they wont affect a target further from that<br>
                      ranged: this type of skills can only be used in mid to long range, range is determine by the skill<br>
                      These are somethings to note:
                      <ul>
                          <li>Weapons that are melee ranged can only use melee range skills unless it has the throw or extend funtion</li>
                          <li>They can be unarmed charged melee skills and also armed physical ranged skill</li>
                          <li>they are also physical time skills and others , not only attacks.</li>
                          <li>direct and splash or area of effect skills; direct skills targets only 1 person, 
                              while area skills target more than 1.</li>
                          <li>You can only use a particular skill per action, unless it is stated in the description of the skill that it
                              can be used more than once or it requires more than one action. some skills take turns to recharge for use again thuo.
                              A skill can be wasted, which means, if the move is used in a wrong situation, the move is counted but 
                              will have no effect in the battle.</li>   
                      </ul>
                  </p><br>

                  <h5>Skill types</h5>
                    <p>There are 6 different type of skills the skill type is shown at the skill tag. The 6 types are as follows;<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(trap)Trap Skill: these are skills that activate when a certain condition is met either in opponents or users turn although 
                                user can choose to activate it or not. they are somtimes called reation or bonus actions. trap skills can be take effect once or can be used continously</li>
                            <li>(atk) Attack Skill: these type of skills are used for offense, dealing damage to a target(s). each attack skill as a damage type, some might even deal more than one type</li>    
                            <li>(time) Time Skill: these are skills that take more than one turn to fufll their purpose. time skills have Break power, meaning to destroy a time skill you need a neg or any other skill meant for destruction to have equal or more breaking power than the time skill</li>  
                            <li>(def) Defensive Skill: these are skills that prevent you from losing hp such as sheild ,barriers etc</li>   
                            <li>(neg) Neglecting Skill: these skills stop effects of other skills based on the condition</li>  
                            <li>(gain) Gain Skill: these types of skill increase your stats, hp or cp or even allow you play more than once.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p><br>

                  <h5>Saving throws</h5><br>
                  <p>For skills that use saving throws, you roll a d20 die, then make sure the roll is equal or more than the DC (difficulty class) of the skills. 
                    If it is the skill doesn’t affect you.
                  </p><br>
                  <h5>Requirements</h5>
                    <p>A Skill's components are the physical requirements you need in order to preform it. Each skill's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a skill's requirements, you are unable to preform the skill.<br>
                      Verbal (V)<br>
                      Most skills require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the skill's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of Energy in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence skill, can't use a skill with a verbal component.<br>
                      Somatic (S)<br>
                      skill performing gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a skill requires somatic, the user must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.<br>
                      Material (M)<br>
                      performing some skills requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the requirements entry. A character can use a component pouch or a weapon/items (found in “Equipment”) in place of the required specified for a skill. But if a cost is indicated for a requirement, a character must have that specific component before he or she can use the skill.<br>
                      If a skill states that a material is consumed by the skill, the user must provide this requirement for each performing of the skill. user must have a hand free to access a skill's material -- but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.
                    </p><br>

                    <h5>Duration</h5>
                    <p>A skill's duration is the length of time the skill persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some skills specify that their effects last until the skills are diskilled or destroyed. <b>Note that 10 seconds = 1 turn, a round is when all teams have played</b><br>
                      Instantaneous<br>
                      Many skills are instantaneous. The skill harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be diskilled, because its Energy exists only for an instant.<br>                      
                      Concentration<br>
                      Some skills require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their effect active. If you lose concentration, such a skill ends.<br>                     
                      If a skill must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the skill specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).<br>                      
                      Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration (although all movement speed are halved while on concentration). The following factors can break concentration:<br>
                      *Using another skill that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a skill if you use another skill that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two skills at once.<br>
                      *Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a skill, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.<br>
                      *Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a skill if you are incapacitated or if you die.<br>
                      *User on concentration as disadvantages in attacks by attackers.<br>
                      The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

                <h5>Actions in Combat</h5>
                <p>
                  When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.
                  When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
                </p><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attack: The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
                    With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.                    
                    Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action. when you use a weapon to attack, you use the attack damage that the weapon gives</li>
                  <li>Opportunity Attacks: an Attack of Opportunity is effectively a free attack against an enemy.
                    When taking an opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against a provoking creature, this melee attack can not be aligned with perks or other skills.<br>
                    A creature provokes an opportunity attack when they move out of an enemy’s reach but were not forced to by being pushed by a skill or spell.
                    This is typically when an enemy moves away from being within 5 feet of the attacker. On a battle grid, this means that they are attempting to move to a square that is not adjacent to your character.
                    The attack happens right as the creature is leaving your character’s reach.<br>
                    The best way to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy creature is by taking the Disengage action. If the fight is going bad and you need to fall back, this is how you do it safely.<br>
                    Of course, you can also teleport to safely avoid an opportunity attack. This makes spells like Misty Step and Thunderstep particularly useful!<br>
                    Taking an attack of opportunity is simple enough on the surface: you use your reaction to make an attack against a fleeing enemy. But it’s important to stay tactical in combat and mindful of your character’s action economy. Because this attack uses your reaction, it may not always be a wise decision to take advantage of an opening!</li>
                  <li>Cast a Spell: spellcasters such as mages and priests, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</li>
                  <li>Using a Skill: you can also use your skill with an action, but as usual not every skill needs an action and some even required more than one action.</li>
                  <li>Dash: When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
                    Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</li>
                  <li>Disengage: If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</li>
                  <li>Dodge: When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, if you can see the attacker, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage or attacks against you that isnt wider than 5ft and with Dmg is lower than half your Dex score is dodged (this is counted as a neglect skill so this wont work on skills that cant be neglected, you also lose cp/mana equal to half the mana of the skills you successfully dodged within the period), and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.</li>
                  <li>Help: You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
                    Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage or the attacks BP is increased by your CHA Modifier.</li>
                  <li>Hide: When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.</li>
                  <li>Ready: Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
                    First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."
                    When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.
                    When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</li>
                  <li>Search: When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. you ca still use this action in adventure mode to scavenge for items and materials in that location base on your scavenging stats level.</li>
                  <li>Use an Object: You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</li>
                  <li>Skip: this action helps you rejuvenate energy, when you use this, you lose 2hp but gain 2cp. the cp can surpass cp limit. </li>
                  <li>Aim: this action helps you Aim a particular point with attacks either on creatures or building e.g a dragons tail in other to cut it off so it ca no long use its tail attack, or its wing so it can no longer fly. when you use this, you have to select from the options
                    the target has e.g a humanoid has points like left hand, right hand, neck, right leg, left leg e.t.c. aiming on of this parts allow you to use an action immediately in place of your bonus action and you are in concentration. that action must be an attack skill, 
                    you then have to roll a Aim Check(adding your aim mod to it) of DC equal to the level of the creature + its wis mod + half its con mod, on a success the attack is regarded as a critical hit and deals double the damage(does not double boost or buffs to the attack) and that part is cut off.
                    on a fail the attacks misses and deals no damage at all and your turn ends. that creature is now aware and this action cant be used on them for 1 minute. </li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>Hp and cp/mana</h5><br>
                <p>your hp and cp determine if you can still win the battle or not. hp meaning health points or hit points and cp being called so many things like charge points, mana, ki e.t.c. 
                  the goal of battles are to make sure you reduced your opponents hp to 0 or lower before they do that to you. your hp has a limit, you cant heal above that limit unless with special 
                  effects.
                </p><br>
                <h5>Dying</h5><br>
                <p>when a character hit points "HP" hit 0, the character is knocked out and have the risk of dying if not stabilized early. after a character is knocked out by having their Hp reduced to 0, the creature has turns equal to its CON modifier to live unless it is made Stable.<br>
                although a creature instantly dies if he takes residual damage that is greater than its CON Stats, even if its not enough to kill them at first, as far he keeps taking damage it will pile up until it reaches the score and the creature dies.</p><br>

                    if you have 80 more speed than a target, they cant use reactions for defense skill against your melee attacks. in addition<br>
                    if you have 140 more speed than a target, you can use an addition action against that target only in your turns. in addition<br>
                    if you have 200 more speed than a target, your melee attacks cant be neglected by that target and direct attack skills from that target cant hit you.<br>

                <h5>Coinage</h5><br>
                <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
                  <br>
                  With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
                  <br>
                  One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.
                  <br>
                  One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
                  <br>
                  In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
                  <br>
                  A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p><br>

                  <h5>Techniques</h5>
                  <p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including Techniques that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's Techniques proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)
                    For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated Techniques: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth Techniques is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.<br><br>
                    The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No Techniques are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a Techniques associated with an ability.</p><br>

                    Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific Techniques--for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular Techniques applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a Techniques means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that Techniques. Without proficiency in the Techniques, the individual makes a normal ability check.
                    For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

                    <h5>senses</h5>
                    <p>The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses 
                    the monster might have. Special senses are described below. </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>BLINDSIGHT: A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, 
                          within a specific radius.
                          Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, 
                          as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.<br>
                          If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that 
                          the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.</li>
                        <li>DARKVISION: 
                          A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim 
                          light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The 
                          monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground 
                          have this special sense.</li>
                        <li>TREMORSENSE: 
                          A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided 
                          that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. 
                          Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as 
                          ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.</li>
                        <li>TRUESIGHT: 
                          A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible 
                          creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, 
                          and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, 
                          the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Perks/features</h5><br>
                    <p>Perks/features are additional skills given to you be your class.
                    the more you level up the more perks you get. most perks are like time and trap skills 
                    which can happen over time or need a condition before it could apply. continous perks can always 
                    be used as far their conditions are met. although one perk effect per turn.</p><br>

                    <p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use.

                        difference between life and death while adventuring.<br> The Weapons table shows the most common 
                        weapon families used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their weight and any special properties they possess. 
                        Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 
                        feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.</p><br>

                      <h5>Weapon Proficiency</h5>
                      <p>Your race, class, and others can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or classes of weapons. The two classes are simple and martial. 
                        Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often 
                        found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized 
                        training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and 
                        training to best use.
                        Proficiency with a weapon allows you to use the weapon normally or you make with that weapon. If you make an attack using a weapon 
                        with which you lack proficiency, you divide the dmg by 2.</p><br>
                        <p>weapons can be categorized by class, range and family.
                        <br>
                        <p>classes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>simple weapons</li>
                            <li>martial weapons</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>range</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>melee: this are weapons that can only be used for close range battles.</li>
                            <li>ranged: this are weapons that can only be used for mid to long range battles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p><br>
                        <h5>Weapon Properties</h5>
                          <p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table. </p><br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only 
                                if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend 
                                one or more piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part 
                                of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you 
                                can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield(not applicable to bullets).<br>
                                If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat 
                                the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). 
                                A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</li>
                            <li>ranged. for ranged, if you see the range having two values like this '(250/800)', the first number is the weapons true and unwavering aim, but the second number is its blurry range which will only deal half damage.</li> 
                            <li>Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity 
                                modifier and add it to the attack</li>
                            <li>Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attacks with heavy weapons. 
                                A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</li>
                            <li>Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</li>
                            <li>Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece(or more base on the ammunition stat) of ammunition from it 
                                when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</li>
                            <li>Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach 
                                for opportunity attacks with it.</li>    
                            <li>Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description 
                                (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).</li>  
                            <li>Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, 
                                you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll that you would use for a melee attack 
                                with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, 
                                you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</li>  
                            <li>Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</li>  
                            <li>Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--
                                the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</li> 
                            <li>recoil. This weapon aim diminishes the more it is used in chain, thus decreasing the range by 10 each chained turn but the weapon original range cant be less than 10</li> 
                            <li>Windy. aim deviates if too close or too far</li> 
                            <li>Attunement. Some Magic Items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical Properties can 
                              be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a 
                              class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a Spellcasting class, 
                              a monster qualifies if it has Spell Slots and uses that class’s spell list.). Without becoming attuned to an item 
                              that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. 
                              For example, a magic Shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield to a creature not 
                              attuned to it, but none of its magical Properties. Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a Short Rest(3-4hrs) 
                              focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). 
                              This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity.
                              If the Short Rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, the creature gains an intuitive
                              understanding of how to activate any magical Properties of the item, including any necessary Command words.
                              An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three Magic
                              Items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first.
                                Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of Protection
                                at a time. A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the Prerequisites 
                                for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, 
                                or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item, 
                                unless the item is Cursed.</li>  
                        </ul><br>
                        <h5>Improvised Weapons</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, 
                            such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.<br>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be 
                            treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a 
                            weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.<br>
                            using an improvised weapon to attack counts as a punch or kick which can only be used once and the damage is your pucnh dmg + you attack modifier.
                            anytime you do this your weapon takes damage</p><br>
                        <h5>Silvered or coated Weapons</h5>
                            <p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, 
                            so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver.
                            You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp.<br> 
                            This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed 
                            to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective</p><br>

                        <h5>Special weapons</h5>
                            <p>Weapons with special rules are described here.<br>
                            Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
                            <br>
                            Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
                            <br>
                            When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>   
                        
                        <br><h5>Weapon/items Rarity</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic</li>
                            <li>Rare -- usually have increased weapon Durability</li>
                            <li>Epic -- usually comes with a skill or effect</li>
                            <li>Legendary -- has awakened skills</li>
                            <li>Super Legendary -- ???</li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        <p>a particular item can have different rank, like a piece of cloth can be normal and another 
                          piece of cloth can be epic. also some weapons require some levels in other to use them. normally equipping a weapon require a turn and awakening one also requires a turn. </p><br>
                        <h5>weapon durability</h5>
                        <p>weapons have hp or expiration time, meaning they can be used for some days before getting rusted or destroyed, you can fix a weapon that is about to destroy i.e when its hp is low. you cant fix aux weapons.
                        durability of weapons reduce every time they are used with thier normal attack(this mostly applies to melee weapons), hit other weapons or other harder substances or can be by an external effect<br></p>

                    <p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own Technology level. For this reason, Adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from Leather Armor to Chain Mail to costly Plate Armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Heavy Armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a Shield.
                      The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other Properties of the Common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

                    <h5>Armor Proficiency</h5>
                    <p>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast Spells.</p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Armor Class (AC)</h5>
                    <p>Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. amor class reduces or totally neglects the damage you take, although armor mostly works on Attacks with damages like Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, Piercing and Slashing, you hardly see armor that work on psychic, necrotic or magical(force) damage and lastly magical cold and acid damage give the armor wearer half the damage instead. the table below shows you armor class and the damage they neglect

                    <p>for armors with higher ac, just increase the armor class limit + 4 then the damage it neglects increases by 1</p><br>
                    <p>other than basic armor class, they are allow different types of armor class. e.g<br><br>
                      super armor class:<br> super armor class follow same rules only that even skills that cant be neglected wont work<br><br>
                      Regressive Armor Class:<br> Regressive Armor Class which means The Damage from each attack is reduced instead
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>types/effects of armor</h5>
                    <p>Shields: A Shield is normally made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a Shield increases your Armor Class by 2 unless the shield says otherwise. You can benefit from only one Shield at a time.</p><br>
                    <p>Stealth: If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><br>
                    <p>Heavy Armor: Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><br>
                    <p>Durability: this score is basically your armors hp, when you are hit, even if your armor defends it, your armor takes damage.</p><br>
                    <h5>Classes of Armor</h5><br>
                    <p>Light Armor<br>
                      Made from supple and thin materials, Light Armor favors agile Adventurers since it offers some Protection without sacrificing mobility.</p>
                      <br><ul>
                        <li>Padded: Padded Armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</li>
                        <li>Leather: The Breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</li>
                        <li>Studded Leather: Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</li>
                      </ul><br>
                    <p>Medium Armor<br>
                      Medium Armor offers more Protection than Light Armor, but it also impairs Movement more.</p>
                      <br><ul>
                        <li>Hid⁠e: This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by Barbarian tribes, evil Humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</li>
                        <li>Chain⁠ S⁠hirt: Made of interlocking metal rings, a Chain Shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest Protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</li>
                        <li>Scale M⁠ail: This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</li>
                        <li>Breastp⁠late: This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good Protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</li>
                        <li>Half⁠ Plate: Half Plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg Protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</li>
                      </ul><br>
                    <p>Heavy Armor
                      Of all the armor categories, Heavy Armor offers the best Protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. 
                      Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ring Mail: This armor is Leather Armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from Swords and axes. Ring Mail is inferior to Chain Mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.</li>
                        <li>Chain Mail: Made of interlocking metal rings, Chain Mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</li>
                        <li>Splint: This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible Chain Mail protects the joints.</li>
                        <li>Plate: Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</li>
                      </ul><br>

                <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, 
                    a class feature, a monster's Attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, 
                    but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. they can even still take place after the battle.<br>
                    A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for 
                    example) or for a Duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.<br>
                    If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has 
                    its own Duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition 
                    or doesn't.<br>
                    The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

                    If the party’s or player stealth check beats the Targets’ passive perceptions, the Targets will be considered surprised when combat starts.
                    A creature or player that is surprised cannot move or take actions in the first round of combat. For the ambushing party, it’s a free round!
                    The surprised creature also can’t take reactions until after their first turn in the round. This means that the surprised creature or players can’t make attacks of opportunity until they are no longer surprised at the end of their first turn.
                    After this first round of combat (the “surprise round”), combat proceeds back to the top of the initiative order.

                    Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
                    Any Attack that hits the creature is a (critical hit dealing double damage) if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhaustion<br>
                    Some Special Abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-­term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, 
                    can lead to a Special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a 
                    creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.
                    <br>
                    Exhaustion Effects;<br>
                    Level Effect<br>
                    1 Disadvantage on Ability Checks<br>
                    2 Speed halved<br>
                    3 Disadvantage on Attack rolls and saving throws<br>
                    4 Hit point maximum halved<br>
                    5 Speed reduced to 0<br>
                    6 Death<br>
                    If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
                    <br>
                    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on Ability Checks.
                    <br>
                    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
                    <br>
                    Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p><br>

                        <p>Different attacks, damaging Spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, 
                          such as damage Resistance, rely on the types.<br>with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect,The damage types are:</p><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Acid: The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a Black Pudding deal acid damage.</li>
                        <li>Bludgeoning: Blunt force attacks—hammers, Falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.</li>
                        <li>Cold: The infernal chill radiating from an Ice Devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.</li>
                        <li>Fire: Red dragons breathe fire, and many Spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</li>
                        <li>Force: Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are Spells, including Magic Missile and Spiritual Weapon.</li>
                        <li>Lightning: A Lightning Bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.</li>
                        <li>Necrotic: Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as Chill Touch, withers matter and even the soul.</li>
                        <li>Piercing: Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.</li>
                        <li>Poison: Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.</li>
                        <li>Psychic: Mental Abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</li>
                        <li>Radiant: Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s Flame Strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</li>
                        <li>Slashing: Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.</li>
                        <li>Thunder: A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the Thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.</li>
                        <li>Fall Damage: Fall damage is bludgeoning damage taken when a character falls from a high place. fall damage is calculated by; when a character is more than 10ft above ground. the damage increases by 0.5 for every 5ft</li>
                    </ul><br><br>

                    <h5>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h5><br>
                <p>Some creatures and Objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
                    If a creature or an object has Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an 
                    object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it but in some special cases the damage multiplier or adder
                    might be stated e.g Resistance(-3), this means the damage -3 and so on.
                    .<br><br>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has Resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. 
                    The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage, this rule apply to all de buff system.
                    Multiple instances of Resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has Resistance to fire damage as well as Resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-- quarters.
                    
                    --</p><br>
                <h5>Damage immunity</h5><br>
                <p>If a creature is immune to this damage type, it does no damage to that creature at all.
                  If its condition immunities means this status effect don’t affect this creature 
                  </p><br>

                  <div class="spells_rules_box" style="display: none;">
                    <h5>what is a spell?</h5>
                    <p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect--in most cases, all in the span of seconds.<br>
                      Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.<br>                      
                      Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p><br>
                  
                    <h5>Spell levels</h5>
                    <p>Every spell has a level/tier from 0 to 10 (legend as it that there are spells above X-tier). A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level/tier and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. <br>Cantrips -- simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote -- are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.
                      Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, some characters have to be at least 34th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Known and Prepared Spells</h5>
                    <p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
                      In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.</p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Casting spells with mana/cp</h5>
                    <p>various spells require mana/cp to cast. if it is not specified on the spell, the default cp/mana required to cast a spell is the spells level/tier + 2 but for cantrips is 1</p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Casting spells to an higher level/Tier</h5>
                    <p>you can cast lower lv spells at higher lv if it is shown in their description, but you must be able to attain the spell lv you which to cast the spell to. you can only cast spells to certain levels depending on your lv as shown in the table below where spell upgrade is the amount of tier/levels above normal you can cast your spells to. for example, you casting a tier 2 fireball spell to tier 3.
                      <table>

                          <th>character level</th>

                      </table>
                    </p>
                    <p>you cant upgrade spells more than x-tier/level 10</p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Ritual spells</h5>
                    <p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't use cp/mana, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.
                      To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The priest and the beast-person, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the mage's does.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Casting time</h5>
                    <p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.<br>
                      <b>Bonus Action:</b> A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.<br>
                      <b>Reactions:</b> Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.<br>
                      <b>Longer Casting Times:</b> Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't lse mana.cp. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.
                    </p><br>

                    <h5>Range</h5>
                    <p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.
                      Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.
                      Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you. 
                      Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.
                    </p><br>

                    <h5>Components</h5>
                    <p>A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.<br>
                      Verbal (V)<br>
                      Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.<br>
                      Somatic (S)<br>
                      Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.<br>
                      Material (M)<br>
                      Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.<br>
                      If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components -- or to hold a spellcasting focus -- but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.
                    </p><br>

                    <h5>Duration</h5>
                    <p>A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. <b>Note that 10 seconds = 1 turn, a round is when all teams have played</b><br>
                      Instantaneous<br>
                      Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.<br>                      
                      Concentration<br>
                      Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.<br>                     
                      If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).<br>                      
                      Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration (although all movement speed are halved while on concentration). The following factors can break concentration:<br>
                      *Casting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.<br>
                      *Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.<br>
                      *Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.<br>
                      The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.
                    </p><br>

                    <h5>Combining Magical Effects</h5>
                    <p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap, or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap.
                      For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h4>Spells-- Schools of magic</h4><br>
                    <p>There are 8 total schools of magic in Anime force. These schools are; Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. They have a wide range of abilities, and these descriptions only scratch the surface of what this magic is able to handle.
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Abjuration</h5>
                    <p>
                      This is the most defensive school of magic. Abjuration spells are primarily used for protection, self-buffing, and counterspelling. If your Wizard wants to be a potent anti-caster, then they should probably try to find Abjuration spells.
                      Some critical Abjuration spells to know about include the Protection spells, Counterspell, the Dispel Magic series, and Banishment. The Protection spells, like Protection from Evil and Good, are perfect counters to specific combats, and thus critical for a highly prepared magic user. Counterspell and Dispel Magic are both important for destroying powerful magic from bosses or dangerous creatures. Banishment is a unique spell that takes an enemy entirely out of combat for a while, which is great for isolating important targets.
                      Abjuration is a critical school for protecting your Wizard as well. Spells like Mage Armor and Shield will keep your AC high enough to block projectiles or melee attacks. You can also put those buffs on your allies to keep them in front of you long enough to weave your spells! Against dragons, spells like Protection from Energy can absorb a ton of damage, enough to keep you alive for a long time.
                      There are a ton of other abjuration spells, though! Use them to protect your party, protect your camp, or protect your AC!
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Conjuration</h5>
                    <p>
                    Conjuration is arguably the second most aggressive spell school. This school is responsible for the summoning spells and high-damage single target effects. However, and perhaps more importantly, it is the school of creation; if there’s magic that summons or constructs something, it’s in the Conjuration school.
                    Important spells from this school include the Summoning spells tree, Entangling effects, Teleportation, and a wide variety of damaging effects. Summons are creatures that the caster controls that join combat for a limited amount of time. They are perfect for soaking up damage or even dealing a lot of it! Entangling spells, like Entangle or Web, will help you control combat. There are actually a pretty decent number of Conjuration spells that are specifically for combat control! Teleportation is critical in late game Anime force, and to get there you need to learn some Conjuration magic. Dimension Door, Misty Step, and Teleportation are great spells in this category. Finally, there’s a wide variety of just hard damage magic that you can look forward to! These spells don’t tend to be massive explosions, but there are areas of effect like Cloud of Daggers or Cloudkill that allow you to chase opponents. 
                    This school has a ton of Concentration effects; they’re efficient uses of spell slots, but might not always do great burst damage right off the bat. Remember what spells have concentration, because they might inhibit your ability to cast!. A great school that can do a wide variety of magical effects. Just remember that a lot of the constructions that Conjuration can make are magical, and thus are likely to be dispellable. 
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Divination</h5>
                    <p>
                      Divination is the school of information gathering. It is responsible for a specific niche of magic, where the user is able to find out new things. Whether it be by magical eyeballs, swiftly learning a new language, or simply understanding where things are, Divination is key if you want to survive.
                      Some important spells here include the Detect spells, Clairvoyance, the Augury effects, and the Language effects. Detect spells are really strong, allowing you to find magic where it is otherwise invisible (or even finding creatures that are invisible!). Clairvoyance (and spells like Arcane Eye or Locate Creature) are good for scouting specific locations or people to ensure they are safe. Augury and Commune, as well as other effects like them, allow the player to gain some level of insight from their DM. This can be useful for mediating party conflicts. Language spells, like Comprehend Languages and Tongues, might help you perform diplomacy where it was otherwise impossible.
                      There are more spells to talk about, such as Hunter’s Mark (a damage-oriented spell), but that’s the jist of Divination!
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Dunamancy</h5>
                    <p>
                      Dunamancy is an interesting school of magic involving the manipulation of reality. There are essentially two different schools within dunamancy, graviturgy and chronurgy. Graviturgy involves the manipulation of gravity while chronurgy is magic that warps time itself. Remember, this type of magic is exclusive to Wildemount setting and does not exist in most WOTC settings.
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Enchantment</h5>
                    <p>
                      The Enchantment school is devoted to ruining the day of others, or buffing your allies to help out. The Enchantment school targets the mind of their opponents, rupturing thoughts or forcing statuses that even the strongest Barbarian can hardly resist.
                      The spells of Enchantment are all fairly similar in the long run. The standard Enchantment spell requires a Wisdom save, or the target is forced to follow the orders of the caster to some degree. The range of Enchantment varies drastically; from a simple Charm to Frighten, to outright mental control. You may recognize spells like Dominate Person, Charm Person, Enthrall, Hex, Hold Person, and Modify Memory. These are all very strong Enchantment spells.
                      Enchantment also has a somewhat more niche purpose; buffs. Spells like Bless, Heroism, and Motivational Speech cause your allies to work harder, ignore pain, and do more.
                      There are also a few enchantment spells that deal damage, such as Tash’s Mind Whip or Psychic Scream. These are some of the only ways to get Psychic damage in the game, so, not a bad idea to consider!
                      Enchantment schools are not effective against those without minds. Don’t try and Dominate a massive Rat, because it probably won’t work!
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Evocation</h5>
                    <p>
                      Evocation is the school of the damage dealer. This school is fairly similar to Conjuration in flavor; however, where Conjuration focused on creation of magical constructs, Evocation is the creation of pure elemental forces to do your dirty work. This is the highest damage school of magic by far, and is perhaps the most well-known school.
                      Standouts of this school include the classic Area of Effect spells; Fireball, Lighting Bolt, Earthquake, Thunderwave, and plenty more. These spells are super important for taking down groups of enemies, something that most melee or martial classes have trouble doing. You can clear out rooms really fast by spending spell slots on Evocation spells.
                      Evocation is also used for some single-target effects. Things like Chromatic Orb, Divine Word, the Power Word series, Magic Missile… These and a ton more are specifically for removing a singular target from the fight as soon as possible. They do more burst damage than spells like Spiritual Weapon, but they tend to not do damage for more than one turn.
                      However, did you know that healing magic is Evocation? That’s right; Cure Wounds, Heal, and Healing Word are all Evocation spells. That means your standard priest will be slinging loads of healing magic, and preparing to counter evocation might mean stopping a healer from doing their work.
                      If it’s about manipulating matter and energy, more than creating something specific, it’s gonna be Evocation.
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Illusion</h5>
                    <p>
                      Illusion spells are like Enchantment, but focus more on tricking the mind than direct manipulation. Illusions change the senses of the target, convincing them that there’s something there that is not truly there. It is by far the most DM-dependant school; Illusion can be easily ignored if it is not played into! But, a good illusionist can cause an army to surrender. Knowing your illusion magic can save your skin, or at least save you from missing treasure.
                      Illusion magic is basically split into two categories; Creative Illusions and Mechanical Illusions. Creative Illusions are spells that require you to craft them individually, and thus are stronger the more applicable they are to the situation. Spells like Creation, Disguise Self, Illusory Script, and the Major Image Tree are all in this category. As you become better and better at Anime force, and as long as your DM is willing to play along, these spells will be really fun, and potentially very strong. Great at problem solving, at least!
                      Mechanical Illusions have set effects and DCs, which means they are more akin to the other schools of magic. These spells include Blink and Invisibility, buffs that are insanely strong and help you survive for a long time. Spells like Color Spray allow you to distract enemies with a DC, potentially incapacitating them if it’s early enough.
                      However, Illusions also have damage effects. Illusory Dragon is an illusory Area of Effect, Mental Prison deals Psychic damage and incapacitates someone, and Shadow Sword just deals good damage. This is not the best damage school by any means, but forming illusions to suit your goals is helpful nonetheless!
                      Like Enchantment, these really only work against creatures that can be charmed and have brains. Keep that in mind, and make sure you have some other spells just in case!
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Necromancy</h5>
                    <p>
                      Necromancy is a weird and unique offensive school, focused on manipulating the plane of death. Rather than sticking to combat control and damage, like Conjuration and Evocation, Necromancy does a wide variety of effects. A true Necromancer allies themselves with the dead, but any Necromancy magic relies on a living (or formally living) being to work.
                      Some notable necromancy magic include some of the damaging spells. Spells like Enervation, Finger of Death, Harm, and Vampiric Touch harm your enemies, but tend to have another effect attached. Finger of Death, for instance, deals a massive amount of damage, but requires you to land an attack roll and for them to fail a save. Vampiric Touch heals the caster, letting you deal damage while keeping yourself alive.
                      Necromancy is also a great debuffing school, with powerful spells like Blight, Contagion, and Ray of Sickness. These are not necessarily as brutal as the debuffs from Enchantment, but they deal a bit of damage on the way, and can be a more direct inhibitor to the enemy’s ability to attack you.
                      Necromancy is also a summoning school, in more ways than one! You can summon skeletons or spirits using Necromancy and build an undead army. Or, you use Necromancy to bring party members back to life. That means that every Priest should have a tiny bit of Necromancy in their spell repertoire!
                      Necromancy has a ton of different magical effects, but they all have to deal with Necrotic damage, or some way of inhibiting the opponent. This is the de facto school of Necromancers and Liches. If you want to fight them, find ways to resist necrotic damage, sickness, and… well, never be too low on health. There are a few spells in there that ignore the Dying state and just remove you from the game!
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Transmutation</h5>
                    <p>
                      Transmutation is the school that focuses on changing the user, or the user’s allies, and making them better. As the primary buffing school, Transmutation focuses on altering the user or environment to fit your needs. That does mean that Transmutation has some similarities with Conjuration, though instead of creating solutions, you alter things around you to make them into solutions.
                      Transmutation’s best quality comes from buffs. This is the school where very strong buffs, like Fly and Haste, come from. These spells (among others), when spread around your party, will help increase durability and damage. While you won’t be dealing damage specifically, the problem solving of your other party members will increase far beyond what is normal for their class! 
                      That doesn’t mean that Transmutation is without damage. While it is sub-par at damage, spells like Dragon Breath, Cordon of Arrows, and Heat Metal all have their uses. And all players remember their first encounter with a Disintegrate spell. If you want to deal damage, Transmutation can sometimes be absolutely devastating.
                      If that wasn’t quite enough, the school also has some debuffs and status effects. Flesh to Stone can instantly end a fight, if the target fails their saving throw. Polymorph and Mass Polymorph can completely ruin a group of enemies, allowing you to choose who you target.
                      Transmutation has utility spells as well; a ton of the Shape magic, like Shape Water or Move Earth, can allow you to skip entire portions of dungeons. You also have spells like Meld into Stone, Reverse Gravity, and Speak with Plants, which can provide you some weird utility in the short run!
                      Transmutation is a relatively wide and varied school, but is all about changing their environment. The best buffs in the game are here, and some of the best debuffs are here too!
                    </p><br>

                    <h4>Spells-- Spellbook</h4><br>
                    <h5>Copying a Spell into the Book</h5>
                    <p>
                      When you find a Mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
                      Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Mage who wrote it. You
                      must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
                      For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>The Book's Appearance</h5>
                    <p>
                      Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Replacing the Book</h5>
                    <p>
                      You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
                      If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
