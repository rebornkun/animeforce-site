While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><br>

                        <p>This rpg class doesn’t get anywhere near the recognition it deserves. The type of player that 
                            picks and levels a Priest type is the very definition of morally sound. These people should be 
                            worshipped as gods by all of the lesser DPS types. While technically a subclass of mage, they 
                            are critical to a diverse party. This class uses magic but mostly divine magic for healing and others.

                                      <p>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and the fuel both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.
                                        The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as leanering and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand.</div>

                            If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about.{in battle, you can read its next move including perks and techniques he plans to use}) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute(6 turns).

                        <p><strong>COMBAT STYLE: </strong>you commit yourself to a unique combat style. choose a combat style below;<br>
                        <br>
                        1*Way of the Open Hand -- battle mages of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.<br>
                        #Open Hand Technique: when you choose this tradition at this level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:<br>
                        • It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.<br>
                        • It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.<br>
                        • It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.<br><br>
                        2*WAY OF THE DRUNKEN MASTER -- The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master’s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats. A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.<br>
                        #Bonus Proficiencies: you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies if you don’t already have it.<br>
                        #Drunken Technique: you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, in the next turn you can use dodge, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.
                        </p><br>
                        <p><strong>Deflect Missiles: </strong>when a ranged weapon attack is used at you, you can spend 2 ki points/cp to catch the missile, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier + your battle mage level.
                            If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with 
                            the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a battle mage weapon for the attack, which has 
                            a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet dealing the original damage it would have dealt.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Ranger Archetype: </strong>you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 6th level and again at 14th, 22th, and 35th level.<br><br>
                        1*Hunter-- Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.
                        <br>#Hunters Prey: you gain one of the following features of your choice.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Colossus Slayer- Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d4 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</li>
                            <li>Giant Killer- When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. only once per turn</li>
                            <li>Horde Breaker- Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.</li>
                        </ul></p><br>
                        <p>
                        2*Beast Master-- The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
                        <br>#Ranger’s Companion: you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your wisdom modifier bonus to the beast’s AC, attacks, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
                        The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, use skill, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.

                        <p>Assassin characters typically combine combat ability with strong stealth skills, and specialise in defeating an enemy without becoming involved in a protracted melee.
                            Assassin classes usually have attacks that cause a high amount of damage in a short amount of time. This type of damage dealing is often referred to as burst damage by players. Typically, once the Assassin player expends resources during the offensive, the player is left defensively vulnerable and unable to continue the offensive until said resources are regained, hence the "burst" moniker.

                        <p>Tank characters deliberately attract enemy attention and attacks (potentially by using game mechanic that force them to be targeted) to act as a decoy for teammates. Since this requires them to endure concentrated enemy attacks, they typically rely on a high health pool or support by friendly healers to survive while sacrificing their own damage output.
                            Since they keep other members of a team alive, tanks often take on an unofficial leadership role.

                        <p>2*Arcane mage -- those who emulate this archetype employ a paticular/unique magic technique passed from generations. You can use spells of different elements and types.<br>
                            #Spellcasting: As a student of arcane magic, you have a spell book containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. some spells require DC, in this case your spell DC is 10 + your Int Modifier + spell tier/lv<br>
                            #Cantrips: cantrips are minor spells which don’t even count as tier 1. At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels.<br>
                            #Spellbook: At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing 3 tier 1 mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the mage spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. you can store one more spell in your spellbook as you increase your class level determined by the table below<br>
                            #Casting Spells: To cast one of these spells. To cast a spell, you use spell counters, your spell counter is equal to your class level. cantrips do not use spell counters in other to work. to cast a tier 1 spell you need 1 spell counter, to cast a tier 2 spell you need 2 spell counter and tier 3 needs 3 tier counter. you can always cast spells as far you have spell counters left and you can cast a particular spell repeatedly. 
                            when all your spell counters are expended, you need to wait after a long rest for it to be replenish.<br>
                            #Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher: each time you get a spellbook space, you can add one mage spell of your choice from the mage class spell list to your spellbook for free. The level tier you can add can be determine by by the table below, On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.<br>
                            #Casting spells with mana/cp: Various Spells Require Mana/Cp To Cast. If It Is Not Specified On The Spell, The Default Cp/Mana Required To Cast A Spell Is The Spell's Level/Tier + 2 But For Cantrips Is 1<br>

                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Abjuration at this lv: *Arcane Ward-- you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your Mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Conjuration at this lv: *Minor Conjuration-- when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Divination at this lv: *Portent-- when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Enchantment at this lv: *Hypnotic Gaze-- your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Mage spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Evocation at this lv: *Sculpt Spells-- you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Illusion at this lv: *Improved Minor Illusion-- you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different Mage cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Necromancy at this lv: *Grim Harvest-- you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.
                            <br>#if the school you chosed at 4th lv is Transmutation at this lv: *Minor Alchemy-- when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Mage spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

                            • The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your Mage level.<br>
                            • The creature adds your Int bonus to its weapon damage/ damage rolls.

When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options: <br>
                            • Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in Rules<br>
                            • An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered<br>

                            • Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)<br> 
                            Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.

When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Mage spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw.

                            **Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.<br>
                            **Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.<br>

                        <p><strong>Spell Mastery: </strong>you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Mage spell and a 2nd- level Mage spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
                                 By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Divine Sense: </strong>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire 
                            Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
                            You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

                        <p><strong>Lay on Hands: </strong>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 3.
                            As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
                            Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
                            This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

                            #Oath of Devotion: The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms<br><br>
                            Tenants of Devotion: Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</li>
                                <li>Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</li>
                                <li>Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</li>
                                <li>Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</li>
                                <li>Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</li>
                            </ul><br>
                        <p>Oath of The Ancients: The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.<br><br>
                            Tenants of The Ancients: The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</li>
                                <li>Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the w ickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</li>
                                <li>Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world. Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Oath of Vengeance: The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the w ill of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins— sometimes called avengers or dark knights —their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.<br><br>
                            Tenants of The Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins w ho uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil. </li>
                                <li>No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not. </li>
                                <li>By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</li>
                                <li>Restitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p><br>

                        <p><strong>Oath Spells: </strong>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
                            If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
