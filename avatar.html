                        <p>You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. 
                            Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, 
                            gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow priest defies the traditional gender divisions of 
                            drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.
                            <br> You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is 
                            often seen as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. 
                            You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, 
                            or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is 
                            for you to decide.</p><br>

                            on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his 
                            or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be 
                            tall or just heavy.
                            If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight 
                            table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) 
                            beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier 
                            column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight. 
                            For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a 
                            total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 
                            pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 
                            146 pounds.</p><br>

                        <h4>Other Physical Characteristics</h4><br>
                        <p>You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, 
                            you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, 
                            or a tattoo. but some races already have this predetermined for you.</p><br>
                            <h4>Personal Characteristics</h4><br>
                        <p>Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.
                            <br>
                            Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p><br>
                            <h5>Personality Traits</h5><br>
                            <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.
                                <br>
                                Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.
                                <br>
                                A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p><br>
                            <h5>Ideals</h5><br>
                            <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.
                                <br>
                                Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?
                                <br>
                                You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p><br>
                            <h5>Bonds</h5><br>
                            <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.
                                <br>
                                Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?
                                <br>
                                Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p><br>
                            <h5>Flaws</h5><br>
                            <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p><br>

                    <div class="Backgrounds_box" style="display: none;">
                
                        <p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became 
                            an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a 
                            grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by 
                            as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.<br>
                            Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. 
                            The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing 
                            whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase 
                            your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? 
                            How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share 
                            your background?
                            The sample background in this chapter provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, 
                            and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p><br>
                        <h5>Background Proficiencies</h5><br>
                        <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two techniques. In addition, most backgrounds give a 
                            character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in the Equipment section.
                            <br>
                            If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different 
                            proficiency of the same kind (technique or tool) instead.</p><br>
                        <h5>Additional Languages</h5><br>
                        <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages” earlier in this section.</p><br>
                        <h5>Background Equipment</h5><br>
                        <p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from the Equipment section to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p><br>
                        <h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><br>
                        <p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.</p><br>
                        <h5>Customizing a Background</h5><br>
                        <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character. 
                            To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two techniques, 
                            and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the 
                            equipment package from your background or spend coins on gear as described in the Equipment section. 
                            (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, 
                            choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches 
                            your desired background, work with your DM to create one.</p><br>

                        <p>A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. 
                            Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other 
                            describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments 
                            define the possible combinations.<br>
                            These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that 
                            alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are 
                            perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</li>
                                <li>Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestial, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</li>
                                <li>Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</li>
                                <li>Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</li>
                                <li>Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</li>
                                <li>Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</li>
                                <li>Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</li>
                                <li>Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</li>
                                <li>Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</li>

                        <p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or 
                            more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
                            <br>
                            Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. 
                            With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret 
                            language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.
                            <br>
                            Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial 
                            language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. 
                            Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.</p><br>

                        <p>Six Abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strength, measuring physical power</li>
                    <li>Dexterity, measuring agility</li>
                    <li>Constitution, measuring endurance</li>
                    <li>Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
                    <li>Wisdom, measuring perception and insight</li>
                    <li>Charisma, measuring force of personality</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores 
                    define these qualities—a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.</p><br>
                <p>your ability score is 5 on all sections, then you are then given 30 points for you to place the scores where they are wanted. 
                    On average, this will produce a typical individual selected at random from the population.</p>
                <p>ability check and the saving throw rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes 
                    the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the 
                    six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p><br>
                    <h5>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h5><br>
                    <p>Each of a creature's Abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. 
                        An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's 
                        Training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p><br>
                    <p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many Monsters are a cut above 
                        average in most Abilities. A score of 23 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers 
                        can have scores as high as 25, and Monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 50.<br>
                        Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) 
                        to +20 (for a score of 50). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the 
                        range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 50.</p><br>
